                  consider the following tips for finding attractive white gold
                  diamond studs for a great price.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are a variety of diamond studs earrings on the market.
                  Consider the following when making a purchase:
                </p>
                <h5>What is the shape of her face?</h5>
                <p>
                  If her face is thin, then a round cut diamond studs will look
                  best. If her face is broader in appearance, then princess cut
                  diamond studs will complement her look. You'll want to match
                  up the right diamond for the right face to give her the right
                  look.
                </p>
                <h5>What is her skin tone?</h5>
                <p>
                  The metal setting for the diamond should match her skin tone.
                  White gold or platinum sets off a cool skin tone while yellow
                  gold looks great on a woman with a warm skin tone. Don't
                  settle for a cheap setting either - no diamond should be
                  mounted on anything but a quality background.
                </p>
                <h5>Did you find the right setting?</h5>
                <p>
                  The snugger the diamond is against the ear, the better.
                  Crown-style settings push the diamond too far out and away
                  from the ear, lending a gangly appearance, while three- and
                  four-prong martini or basket settings look elegant and
                  refined.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When it comes time to shop for diamond studs, visiting your
                  local jeweler is one choice to help you find a pair that she
                  likes. However, the internet is also a place many men like to
                  shop as nothing beats the convenience or value of shopping
                  online.
                </p>

                  step up to the next level and purchase earrings with a greater
                  carat weight.

                </p>
                <p>
                  The internet has changed the way that people shop as the
                  availability of goods has expanded from local selling to a
                  global marketplace. Truly, you can be living in New York and
                  do your online shopping with merchants who are located in Hong
                  Kong, Abu Dhabi, Los Angeles and elsewhere. Lower overhead and
                  stiffer competition has forced prices down, bringing deals to
                  consumers as never seen before.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even though a website may be selling diamond studs, not all
                  merchants and not all diamond studs are equal. Some things to
                  keep in mind when shopping for diamond studs include:
                </p>
                <h5>Types of diamond studs</h5>
                <p>
                  studs - Princess cut diamonds look great on a woman with a
                  broader face while round diamonds complement the woman whose
                  face is narrow. Choose the setting based on your skin tone,
                  with white gold or platinum enhancing the look of a woman with
                  a cool skin tone and yellow gold matching well with the woman
                  who has a warm skin tone. Visit this skin tone page to
                  determine what your tone is if you are uncertain.
                </p>
                <h5>Choice of settings</h5>
                <p>
                  settings - You'll find plenty of retailers selling diamond
                  studs in a variety of settings, but some settings look much
                  better than others. For example, a crown setting pushes the
                  diamond too far out, giving it a hanging look. Three-prong
                  pave or martini, four-prong basket, or six-prong coronets are
                  well-fitting and look beautiful. Every wedding bride wants the
                  best look on her special day.
                </p>
                <h5>Previewing diamond studs</h5>
                <p>
                  One concern online shoppers have about diamond shopping is
                  previewing the product before making a purchase.
                </p>
                <h5>Buying your studs</h5>
                <p>
                  Some online merchants are experienced jewelers, having gained
                  practice working with customers face to face while others are
                  resellers who are simply trying to capitalize on the
                  marketplace. You'll want to deal directly with a professional
                  jeweler who knows diamonds, stocks his own inventory, and
                  offers generous insurance, shipping and return policies. Never
                  purchase jewelry from an unsecured site and be careful when
                  purchasing your diamonds overseas as you may not be able to
                  enjoy the consumer protection you do here.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Diamond studs make every woman feel and look beautiful,
                  offering brilliance and clarity unlike anything else she will
                  wear. Whether purchased for engagement, wedding, birthday or
                  anniversary, she'll always remember your gift and your warm
                  expression of love!
