                <p>
                  There are three different criteria used to determine a fancy
                  color diamond’s color and intensity:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The diamond’s primary color (i.e. pink)</li>
                  <li>The diamond’s secondary color (i.e. purplish)</li>
                  <li>
                    The intensity of the diamond’s color (i.e. fancy, fancy
                    intense, fancy vivid)
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The primary and secondary colors determine the tone of the
                  diamond’s color. The strength of the color is defined by its
                  level of intensity. As a general rule of thumb, a fancy color
                  diamond becomes more valuable as the color intensity
                  increases. The classifications for fancy color diamonds are as
                  follows: faint, very light, light, fancy light, fancy, fancy
                  intense, fancy vivid/fancy deep/fancy dark.

                <h4 className="text_primary">Fancy Yellow</h4>
                <p>
                  Yellow diamonds (also known as canary diamonds) are the most
                  well-known of all fancy diamonds. Although many white diamonds
                  appear yellow and are listed on the far end (Y-Z) of the
                  standard diamond color scale, they are not considered fancy
                  yellow diamonds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A yellow diamond is considered fancy when it is graded
                  according to the terms: light yellow, fancy light yellow,
                  fancy yellow, fancy intense yellow, fancy dark yellow, fancy
                  deep yellow, and fancy vivid yellow. True fancy yellow
                  diamonds have a strong vivid color, and are generally more
                  expensive per carat due to their rare beauty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Roughly 60% of all fancy color diamonds are yellow diamonds.
                  Yellow diamonds contain nitrogen, which is responsible for
                  giving the diamond its yellow color.

                <h4 className="text_primary">Fancy Pink</h4>
                <p>
                  Pink diamonds are some of the most alluring fancy diamonds on
                  the market. Due to their extreme rarity, pink diamonds are
                  some of the most valuable stones that you can buy. Pink
                  diamonds can contain any of the following hues: very light
                  pink, light pink, fancy light pink, fancy pink, fancy intense
                  pink, fancy vivid pink, fancy deep pink.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike other fancy color diamonds, it is unclear what exactly
                  causes pink diamonds to exhibit pink hues. Though the exact
                  cause is still a mystery, some scientists theorize that it is
                  due to an atomic-level lattice defect, which selectively
                  absorbs light and produces a pink hue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Very saturated pinks and purplish pinks are incredibly rare
                  and often used as collectors’ items. When a rare vivid pink or
                  purplish pink is released to the market for purchase, it can
                  easily reach millions of dollars per carat.

                <h5>Argyle Pink Diamonds</h5>
                <p>
                  The Argyle Diamond Mine is a diamond mine located in Western
                  Australia, in the remote north. The Argyle Mine is the largest
                  diamond producer in the world as measured by volume. It is
                  also the only known significant source of rare pink diamonds,
                  and produces over 90% of the world’s supply. Furthermore, the
                  Argyle Mine produces a large amount of other naturally colored
                  diamonds, including blue diamonds, cognac diamonds and
                  champagne diamonds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some of our naturally fancy color diamonds come from the
                  Argyle Mine in Australia. Every Argyle Mine Diamond comes with
                  an authentic grading certificate.

                <h4 className="text_primary">Fancy Green</h4>
                <p>
                  Fancy green diamonds are the second rarest fancy color
                  diamonds, after red diamonds. Since green is a mixture of blue
                  and yellow, green colored diamonds commonly range from
                  blue-green to yellow-green. Some fancy green diamonds can also
                  display hints of grey or brown as well. Green diamonds that
                  exhibit no traces of other colors are incredibly rare and
                  valuable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The grading scale for green diamonds is as follows: faint
                  green, very light green, light green, fancy light green, fancy
                  green, fancy intense green, fancy dark green, fancy deep
                  green, and fancy vivid green.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A green diamond is formed over millions of years, after it has
                  been infused with beta and gamma rays, which contributes to
                  the diamond’s green hue. In some cases, the green diamond’s
                  color exists only on the surface, which means that over time,
                  the color will fade. Therefore, pure green diamonds are few
                  and far between.

                <h4 className="text_primary">Fancy Blue</h4>
                <p>
                  Fancy blue diamonds are among some of the rarest colored
                  diamonds and therefore most valuable. The diamonds range in
                  color from light blue to dark blue. The color breakdown for
                  blue diamonds is as follows: faint blue, very light blue,
                  light blue, fancy light blue, fancy blue, fancy intense blue,
                  fancy dark blue, fancy deep blue and fancy vivid blue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other blue diamonds exhibit traces of green or grey. There are
                  a variety of elements that give blue diamonds their
                  distinctive tint. The primary element is boron, followed by
                  hydrogen and nitrogen. Perhaps the most famous fancy blue
                  diamond in the world is the Hope Diamond, which weighs over 45
                  carats.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Blue diamonds are created when the chemical boron becomes
                  trapped in the diamond’s matrix. Blue diamonds usually contain
                  negligible nitrogen impurities.

                <h4 className="text_primary">Fancy Orange</h4>
                <p>
                  Orange diamonds often contain brown, yellow or pink overtones
                  and hues. Fancy orange diamonds typically come from the Argyle
                  mine in Australia, or from South Africa. Orange diamonds are
                  mostly graded as fancy orange, fancy intense orange, fancy
                  vivid orange, fancy deep orange and fancy dark orange.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order for a diamond to be considered orange, it must
                  contain no traces of brown, which is extremely rare. Because
                  true orange diamonds are so rare, less is known about them
                  than other fancy color diamonds, like pink or yellow.
                </p>

              <div className="diamond_detial_box">
                <h4 className="text_primary">Fancy Brown</h4>
                <p>
                  Fancy brown diamonds make a nice alternative from the standard
                  white diamond. Brown diamonds receive their color from a
                  change in the diamond’s molecular structure. Light brown
                  diamonds are known as champagne diamonds and brown diamonds
                  that contain hues of orange are known as cognac diamonds.
