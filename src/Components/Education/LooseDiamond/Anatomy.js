                  While every diamond is unique, all diamonds share certain
                  structural features. A diamond’s anatomy, or its basic
                  structure, determines its proportions, brilliance, dispersion
                  and scintillation. Each part of the diamond has a specific
                  name, and having a basic understanding of how each part
                  contributes to the diamond as a whole will help you find your
                  perfect diamond.

                  Diamond Anatomy While every diamond is unique, all diamonds
                  share certain structural features. A diamond’s anatomy, or its
                  basic structure, determines its proportions, brilliance,
                  dispersion and scintillation. Each part of the diamond has a
                  specific name, and having a basic understanding of how each
                  part contributes to the diamond as a whole will help you find
                  your perfect diamond. A diamond is comprised of the eight main
                  components. They are Diameter, Table, Crown, Table Spread,
                  Girdle, Pavilion, Depth, and Culet. Below is a brief
                  description of each part of a diamond and its location.
                </p>
                <h5>Diameter:</h5>
                <p>
                  The width of a polished stone, measured from edge to edge.
                </p>
                <h5>Table:</h5>
                <p>
                  The largest polished facet located on the top of the diamond.
                </p>
                <h5>Crown:</h5>
                <p>
                  The top part of a diamond extending from the table to the
                  girdle. The crown is made up of bezel facets (crown mains),
                  star facets, upper girdle facets (upper halves), and a table
                  facet.
                </p>
                <h5>Girdle:</h5>
                <p>
                  The very edge (widest edge) of the diamond where the crown and
                  pavilion meet.
                </p>
                <h5>Pavilion:</h5>
                <p>
                  The bottom part of a diamond extending from the girdle down to
                  the culet.
                </p>
                <h5>Depth:</h5>
                <p>
                  The total height of a diamond measured from the table to the
                  culet.
                </p>
                <h5>Culet:</h5>
                <p>
                  The small or pointed facet at the very bottom of the diamond.
                  Before purchasing a diamond, make sure that you have a basic
                  understanding of a diamond’s anatomy. This will allow you to
                  truly appreciate diamonds and all their intricacies,
                  communicate with experts about a particular diamond, and, most
                  importantly, it will assist you in making a well-thought out
                  decision about which diamond is best for you.

                  Proportion – Understanding Brilliance, Dispersion &
                  Scintillation
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Well–proportioned diamonds exhibit three different properties:
                  brilliance, dispersion and scintillation. As light strikes a
                  diamond's surface, it will either reflect off the table of a
                  polished stone or enter the diamond. The light that is
                  reflected is known as the diamond's brilliance — the flash of
                  white light one sees when looking at a stone. As light travels
                  through a stone, some of the light rays are separated into
                  flashes of color. This is known as dispersion. The result of
                  dispersion—the separation of white light into its spectral
                  colors — is known as fire. Scintillation is flashes of color
                  that are viewable as an observer moves a diamond back and
                  forth.
                </p>
                <h5>Putting It All Together</h5>
                <p>
                  Use this interactive tool to see how depth and table
                  percentages can affect the brilliance in a round diamond.
                  Please Note: this example is for a round diamond only—fancy
                  shapes have their own set of unique properties.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div className="diamond_detial_box">
                <h4 className="text_primary">Diamond Symmetry</h4>
                <p>
                  Symmetry refers to the exactness of the shape and arrangement
                  of facets in a diamond. Although to the naked eye finish
                  features only have a tiny effect on appearance, symmetry is
                  significant. In diamonds that have low clarity grades,
                  symmetry is less important, but in diamonds with very high
                  clarity grades, symmetry is very important.
                </p>
                <h5>Wavy Girdle</h5>
                <p>
                  The girdle of a diamond should be a flat plane, parallel to
                  the table. In this example the girdle "waves" as it wraps
                  around the diamond.
                </p>
                <h5>Crown & Pavilion Misalignment</h5>
                <p>
                  In a round diamond the top points of the pavilion mains and
                  the bottom points of the bezel facets should meet precisely at
                  the girdle. We can see in this example the diamond's crown and
                  pavilion facets are misaligned.
                </p>
                <h5>Extra Facets</h5>
                <p>
                  These are typically located on the pavilion, near the girdle,
                  but they can be found anywhere on a diamond. In this example
                  we see where extra facets commonly occur.
                </p>
                <h5>Off-Center Culet</h5>
                <p>
                  To check if the culet is centered, look at the diamond in the
                  face-up position. You'll see the lower girdle facets through
                  the table. If the lines formed by them look like a perfect
                  square, the culet is centered. If the cross bends one way of
                  the other, the culet is not centered. In this example we see
                  what an off-centered culet might look like.
                </p>
                <h5>Off-Center Table</h5>
                <p>
                  The placement of the table (the largest facet on a diamond)
                  should be centered at the top of the stone and needs to be
                  parallel to the girdle. If the table is off-center or not
                  parallel with the girdle this can cause uneven crown angles
                  from one side to the other. In this example we see the
                  unbalanced appearance that occurs from an off-center table.
                </p>
                <h5>Table & Girdle Not Parallel</h5>
                <p>
                  Here we see another example of what occurs when the table is
                  not parallel with the girdle. As you see, the crown angle is
                  much steeper on one-side than the other. From the top view you
                  may have noticed an off-center table.
                </p>
                <h5>Misshapen Face</h5>
                <p>
                  A correct table displays a regular octagon shape. It should
                  have eight sides of equal length that are each parallel to the
                  opposing opposite facet. In this example we see facets that
                  are not properly shaped, or they are not the same size and
                  shape as others like them on the face of the diamond.
                </p>
                <h5>Faces Not Pointing Up</h5>
                <p>
                  Some diamonds display facets that are not properly pointed.
                  Facet patterns of round brilliants are meant to show a precise
                  arrangement of 58 perfectly shaped facets. In this example we
                  see some that some do not meet at a direct point.
                </p>
                <h5>Naturals on Crown and Pavilion</h5>
                <p>
                  A natural is the original "rough" of the diamond. Naturals
                  always occur or start out on the girdle. They either dip
                  towards the pavilion or the crown. In this example we see the
                  natural located on the girdle running down into the pavilion.
                </p>

                <h4 className="text_primary">Diamond Polish</h4>
                <h5>What Is Diamond Polish?</h5>
                <p>
                  Diamond polish influences how well light is able to pass
                  through a diamond. It is a very important attribute in
                  determining a diamond's overall brilliance. When choosing a
                  diamond, it is best to pick one that is laboratory certified
                  with good, very good or excellent polish. Diamonds with poor
                  polish are significantly less brilliant because they have
                  microscopic polish lines that blur the surface of the
                  stone—this also reduces the amount of light that enters or
                  exits the diamond. Be aware that many diamonds have a poor
                  polish because some diamond cutters reduce their costs by not
                  spending sufficient time to properly polish a diamond.
                </p>
                <h5>How Is Polish Graded?</h5>
                <p>
                  Polish is graded the same that way symmetry is graded. On a
                  GIA report, the grades are Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or
                  Poor. The same applies for AGS and IGI reports, which also
                  include ideal in their list.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>EX or E - Excellent, Flawless at 10X magnification</li>
                  <li>
                    VG or VGD - Very Good, Extremely difficult to locate under
                    10X magnification
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    GD, GO, G - Good, Very difficult to see under 10X
                    magnification
                  </li>
                  <li>F, FR, FA - Fair, Noticeable under 10X magnification</li>
                  <li>
                    PR, PO, P - Poor, Easy to see under 10X magnification /
                    Visible to unaided eye
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    VP, VE - Very Poor, Relatively easy to see with the unaided
                    eye
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    EX or EP - Extremely Poor, Obvious to see with unaided eye
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  There is very little difference between these ratings to the
                  unaided eye. A diamond with a polish rating of Good can still
                  be a remarkable stone. It is only under magnification that the
                  differences in these ratings become clearer. Polish rated Fair
                  (FR) and Poor (PR), however, indicates that the flaws in the
                  polish are visible to the naked eye and affect the overall
                  beauty of the diamond.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is also important that your ring does not have a porosity
                  problem or rough spots in the metal. Porosity is when there
                  are little surface holes that get worse as you go deeper into
                  the metal. Generally the result of mass producing rings with
                  poor quality control, porosity makes a ring weak and is
                  non-repairable. A ring with porosity will eventually break
                  down.

                <h4 className="text_primary">Fluorescence</h4>
                <h5>What Is Diamond Fluorescence?</h5>
                <p>
                  Fluorescence is a naturally occurring phenomenon that appears
                  in certain minerals and gems. Some quality diamonds display a
                  visible light when they are exposed to ultraviolet light. This
                  light is known as fluorescence. Under most lighting
                  conditions, a diamond's fluorescence is not visible to the
                  naked eye, although the diamond will exhibit a soft colored
                  glow if held under an ultraviolet lamp.
                </p>
                <h5>Do All Diamond Fluoresce?</h5>
                <p>
                  Not all diamond fluoresce. If a specific diamond does not
                  fluoresce, the grading report will list the diamond's
                  fluorescence as either inert or none.
                </p>
                <h5>What Are The Different Types of Diamond Fluorescence?</h5>
                <p>
                  The degree of fluorescence varies from faint to medium to
                  strong to very strong. Faint means that the stone has a slight
                  glow that is difficult to see under ultraviolet light. Very
                  strong means that the diamond emits a deep glow that is very
                  clear under ultraviolet light. The color of the fluorescence
                  can also vary, although blue is the most common color. Yellow,
                  green and white are other colors that a fluorescent diamond
                  may exhibit.
                </p>
                <h5>How Does Fluorescence Affect A Diamond?</h5>
                <p>
                  Fluorescence usually has no effect on a diamond's appearance
                  in regular lighting conditions. In some cases, however, a
                  strong blue fluorescence can make a yellow colored diamond
                  appear whiter. In rare cases, it can or cause a stone to
                  appear milky or oily.
