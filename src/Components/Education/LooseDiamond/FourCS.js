                <p>
                  The cut of a diamond not only refers to the diamond’s shape,
                  it also refers to how effectively the diamond returns light
                  back to the viewer’s eye. A well-cut diamond will appear very
                  brilliant and fiery, while a poorly cut diamond can appear
                  dark and lifeless, regardless of its color or clarity..
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not only do well-cut diamonds appear more brilliant, they also
                  tend to appear larger than other diamonds of the same carat
                  weight. An "ideal" diamond has both increased brilliance and
                  diameter relative to more deeply-cut diamonds
                </p>
                <h5>Ideal cut diamonds</h5>
                <p>
                  An Ideal Cut Diamond is a round, brilliant, or princess cut
                  diamond that is cut to ideal proportions and angles, and has
                  excellent polish and symmetry ratings. An Ideal Cut Diamond is
                  perfectly proportioned to refract light, producing that fire
                  and brilliance up through to the table and crown.

                <h5>Hearts and Arrows True HeartsTM</h5>
                <p>
                  Seen from above, a Hearts and Arrows diamond shows an arrow
                  pattern. When displayed on its pavilion side, the diamond
                  presents the eye with 8 hearts with tiny 'v' shapes. Genuine
                  Hearts and Arrows have these patterns visible at a single
                  glance, indicating that the diamond has perfect optical
                  symmetry.
                </p>
                <p>

                <h5>Understanding Brilliance, Dispersion & Scintillation</h5>
                <p>
                  A well-cut diamonds exhibit three different properties:
                  brilliance, dispersion and scintillation. As light strikes a
                  diamond's surface, it will either reflect off the table of a
                  polished stone or enter the diamond. The light that is
                  reflected off the diamond is known as the diamond's
                  brilliance. As light travels through a stone, some of the
                  light rays are separated into flashes of color. This is known
                  as dispersion. The result of dispersion—the separation of
                  white light into its spectral colors— is known as fire.
                  Scintillation is flashes of color that are viewable as an
                  observer moves a diamond back and forth.
                </p>

                <h4 className="text_primary">Diamond Color</h4>
                <p>
                  When shopping for a diamond, it is generally preferred to
                  choose a stone with the least amount of color possible.
                  Diamond color is graded on a scale from D-Z and is divided
                  into five broad categories (colorless, near colorless, faint,
                  very light and light). Diamonds come in all colors of the
                  spectrum. The predominant color you see in a diamond is
                  yellow, which is caused by the trace element nitrogen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Generally, when comparing color between two diamonds, the
                  diamonds need to be at least two color grades apart to even
                  begin to see a difference. As you can see from the images
                  below, when diamonds are in the face up position it is almost
                  impossible to see any color. When viewing the diamond from the
                  side profile, you may start to detect some color; however,
                  diamonds are admired for their beauty from the face up
                  position and not the side.
                </p>
                <h5>Colorless Diamonds (D-F):</h5>
                <p>
                  Diamonds within the colorless range are the most rare and
                  valuable of all those on the color scale. D/E color stones
                  display virtually no color, whereas F colored diamonds will
                  display a nearly undetected amount of color when viewed face
                  down by a gemologist.
                </p>
                <h5>Near Colorless Diamonds (G-J):</h5>
                <p>
                  Diamonds within the near colorless range appear colorless in
                  the face up position, but do display a slight amount of color
                  when viewed face down against a perfectly white background.
                  This trace amount of color will be undetectable to an
                  untrained eye once the diamond has been mounted. Near
                  colorless diamonds offer a tremendous value for their price.
                </p>
                <h5>Faint Color Diamonds (K):</h5>
                <p>
                  Diamonds within the faint color category may show a slight
                  hint color when viewed in the face up position; however, these
                  are another wonderful option for those who are not sensitive
                  to color. Some even love the color scheme that is displayed
                  from these diamonds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the most predominant color found in a diamond is yellow,
                  it’s not uncommon for a diamond to take on a brown color. This
                  is thought to be caused by internal graining, which results
                  from structural irregularities often in combination with an
                  impurity like nitrogen.

                <h4 className="text_primary">Diamond Clarity</h4>
                <h5>Which Clarity Grade to Choose?</h5>
                <p>
                  It is important to select a diamond that does not have any
                  inclusions that will affect the overall beauty and durability
                  of the diamond. If you want to be 100% sure that your diamond
                  will be completely clean of "eye-visible" inclusions, stick
                  with diamonds graded "VS2" or higher.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is also a good idea to balance the clarity grade of your
                  diamond with the color. If you are looking at diamonds in the
                  D-F color range, focus on clarity grades of VS2 or higher.
                  Diamonds in the G-I color range combined with SI clarity are
                  excellent values.

                <h4 className="text_primary">Diamond Weight</h4>
                <p>
                  Carat is a term that refers to the weight of a diamond. Prior
                  to the twentieth century, diamonds were measured using carob
                  seeds, which were small and uniform and served as a perfect
                  counter weight to the diamond. The word "carob” is the origin
                  of the word "carat" that we use today.
                </p>
                <h5>Diamond Size and Diamond Carat Weight</h5>
                <p>
                  The size of a diamond is proportional to its carat weight.
                  When rough diamonds are cut and polished into finished
                  diamonds, up to 2/3 of the total carat weight may be lost.
                  Since larger rough gems of high quality are found less
                  frequently than smaller rough gems of high quality, a single
                  two carat diamond will be more expensive than two one-carat
                  diamonds of the same quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the United States, the majority of diamonds used in jewelry
                  and sold as loose diamonds are one carat or less in weight.
                  The average engagement ring diamond sold in the U.S. is less
                  than 1/2 carat in weight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A diamond will increase in weight much faster than it
                  increases in actual "face-up" diameter. For example, while an
                  ideal cut one-carat diamond measures approximately 6.5mm in
                  width, a diamond of twice its weight measures only 8.2mm
                  wide—less than a 30% increase. The graphic to the left helps
                  illustrate this point.
                </p>
                <h5>Which Carat Weight Is Right For You?</h5>
                <p>
                  This question has no direct answer. It is a choice that
                  depends on personal preference and budget. When looking at a
                  diamond engagement ring, what is most visible is the size of
                  the surface area on the top of the diamond. It is difficult to
                  measure a diamond’s carat weight simply by looking at it.
                  Although carat weight influences cost quite a bit, it is
                  advisable to focus on diamond cut and diameter.
