                  Choosing the right metal for an engagement ring is a crucial
                  part of the ring-design process. Once you know a bit about the
                  basics of ring metals, deciding on a metal is a rewarding and
                  simple process. Choosing between white gold, yellow gold, or
                  platinum is as much as matter of personal preference as it is
                  of budget. Before you make a final decision, it is worth
                  weighing the pros and cons of the various types of engagement
                  ring metals.

                <h5>White Gold Engagement Rings</h5>
                <p>
                  White gold is an incredibly beautiful and popular choice for
                  engagement ring settings, which is quickly becoming the number
                  one choice in engagement ring metals. White gold has the
                  overall look of platinum, but is notably less expensive. White
                  gold beautifully compliments diamonds that are rated D-I on
                  the diamond color scale, as it enhances the brilliance and
                  sparkle of the stone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  White gold is typically alloyed with nickel, zinc, silver,
                  and/or palladium to give it its white color and is often
                  plated with rhodium—a shiny, white metal that is a member of
                  the platinum family—to give it an even whiter appearance and
                  protect it from color loss. Although white gold is not subject
                  to tarnish, it may develop a slightly yellow color over time
                  as a result of its 75% yellow gold content. If this happens,
                  white gold’s original beauty can be restored by a simple
                  re-plating.

                <p>
                  Even though white gold is resilient, there are important
                  measures you can take to keep you jewelry looking as good as
                  new. To keep white gold shiny and scratch-free, store it in a
                  soft cloth bag or fabric-lined jewelry box. White gold should
                  be cleaned with mild soap and warm water, using a
                  non-metallic, soft brush (like a toothbrush). To retain white
                  gold’s luster, make sure to keep it away from harmful and
                  corrosive chemicals such as bleach, ammonia and chlorine. And
                  always use a soft, lint-free cloth—never paper towels—to dry
                  the jewelry.
                </p>
                <h5>Yellow Gold Engagement Rings</h5>
                <p>
                  Yellow gold is the most common of the golds, partly because
                  gold is yellow in its naturally occurring state. The yellow
                  gold used in fine jewelry is typically alloyed with silver and
                  copper; its color depends on the amount of pure gold in the
                  alloy. The advantages of gold are that is does not corrode,
                  tarnish or rust, so it can be counted on to provide lasting
                  beauty. And even though it is strong, gold is more "flexible"
                  than the other precious metals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pure gold, graded 24 karats, is too soft for use in making
                  jewelry—as a rule, the higher the karat count, the softer the
                  gold. 18kt gold is composed of 75% gold alloyed with 25% other
                  metals, and is used in the making of fine jewelry. 14kt gold,
                  which is composed of 58.3% gold, is commonly used in jewelry
                  in which strength and hardness are important factors. 10kt
                  gold is made up of 41.7% gold, and 10 karats is the minimum
                  amount of karats an items needs to be classified as real gold
                  in the U.S.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Authentic gold jewelry bears a "karat mark", which is a "k"
                  stamp. According to U.S. law, every gold item must also be
                  stamped with the manufacturer's trademark and country of
                  origin to ensure the authenticity of the gold.

                <h5>Platinum Engagement Rings</h5>
                <p>
                  Platinum is a rare and valuable metal that is only found in
                  limited quantities in a few, select regions of the world. The
                  annual worldwide production of platinum is approximately 160
                  tons, compared to 1,500 tons of gold. This is why platinum is
                  more expensive than the other precious metals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Platinum has grown increasingly popular in recent years due to
                  its beauty and durability. Platinum’s rich, even color and
                  sheen makes it a popular choice for engagement ring settings,
                  as these qualities magnify the sparkle and brilliance of
                  diamonds that are set in the metal. An added bonus of
                  platinum’s 90-95% purity grade is that it rarely causes any
                  allergic reaction, and is therefore the ideal metal choice for
                  people with metal or contact allergies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Platinum is strong and can withstand a lot of stress, more so
                  than other precious metals. It is also a naturally white metal
                  that naturally retains its brilliant white luster naturally—
                  white gold, on the other hand, which is mixed with alloys to
                  give it its white appearance, loses its white shade and begins
                  to yellow over time; white gold jewelry needs to be re-plated
                  during its lifetime in order to maintain its white color,
                  whereas platinum naturally retains its color. Most fine
                  platinum jewelry uses 95% platinum, with 5% alloys. The
                  closely-related iridium, palladium, and ruthenium are alloys
                  that lend additional strength to platinum. In the United
                  States, every piece of platinum jewelry sold must carry a
                  purity stamp. "950 Plat" indicates 95% purity and "900 Plat"
                  indicates 90% purity. In the U.S., anything less than 90% pure
                  platinum cannot be sold as "platinum" jewelry.

                <p>
                  Maintaining the appearance of platinum is as simple as soaking
                  the jewelry in a mild solution of soap and warm water and
                  gently scrubbing with a soft-bristled brush. To keep platinum
                  shiny and scratch-free, store the jewelry in its original box,
                  a soft cloth bag, or a fabric-lined jewelry box. If platinum
                  is worn daily, it may develop a slight sheen. Although most
                  people prefer this look, you can always have jeweler polish
                  platinum jewelry restore it to its original shine.

                <h5>Rose Gold Engagement Rings</h5>
                <p>
                  Rose gold is a gold and copper alloy commonly used for
                  specialized jewelry and coveted for its warm, reddish color.
                  Rose gold is also known as red gold and pink gold, and
                  sometimes as Russian gold, as a result of its popularity in
                  Russia in the early 19th century. The difference between red,
                  rose and pink gold is their copper content.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The higher the amount of copper in gold, the more pronounced
                  the red color. Pure gold is a deep yellow color and pure
                  copper is reddish. The color of rose gold is somewhere on the
                  spectrum between the two, depending on its individual
                  composition. A common alloy for Rose gold is composed of 75%
                  gold and 25% copper by mass.

                  Even though gold is resilient, there are important measures
                  you can take to keep you jewelry looking as good as new. To
                  keep rose gold shiny and scratch-free, store it in a soft
                  cloth bag or fabric-lined jewelry box. Rose gold should be
                  cleaned with mild soap and warm water, using a non-metallic,
                  soft brush (like a toothbrush). To retain rose gold’s luster,
                  make sure to keep it away from harmful and corrosive chemicals
                  such as bleach, ammonia and chlorine. And always use a soft,
                  lint-free cloth—never paper towels—to dry the jewelry.
