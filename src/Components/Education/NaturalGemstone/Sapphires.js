                <p>
                  Blue sapphire is considered a primary color gemstone; the
                  purer the primary hue, the more valuable the gemstone. Blue
                  sapphires are colored by trace amounts of titanium and iron.
                  (By increasing the level of titanium and iron the color
                  saturation is also increased.) The most common secondary hues
                  found in blue sapphires are purple, violet, and green. Violet
                  and purple can contribute to the overall beauty of the color,
                  while green is considered to be the bane of a blue sapphire.
                  The problem is that all blue sapphires will have a greenish
                  component when viewed at the right angle. It is the cutter
                  that makes sure that the green is not part of the face up
                  position in a sapphire. When gray is included in the overall
                  color of the gemstone, often referred to as a gray mask, the
                  sapphire will have a cool or steely quality as opposed to the
                  normal warm velvety hue of a sapphire. Gray is the normal
                  saturation modifier or mask found in blue sapphires and will
                  often mix with green.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Blue sapphires that are eye-clean or entirely free of
                  inclusions are uncommon, especially in larger sizes. However,
                  blue sapphires with some internal inclusions are still highly
                  valued, as long as the inclusions do not reduce brilliance,
                  obscure color, or otherwise detract from the gemstone’s
                  beauty. Blue sapphires of one-carat weight or more are not
                  usually cut to calibrated sizes or standard shapes. Each
                  gemstone is shaped to maximize the color and weight of the
                  gemstone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In blue sapphires, cutting can influence color in surprising
                  ways. Sapphires are dichroic gemstone, meaning their color
                  varies depending on the angle from which it is viewed. Viewed
                  in one direction, most blue sapphires appear blue to
                  violet-blue. From another direction, they will appear slightly
                  greenish blue. A skilled cutter will orient their gemstone so
                  that the blue to violet-blue color shows through the finished
                  gem’s crown.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Silk inclusions are also acceptable in blue sapphires, as long
                  as they are not so dense as to compromise color or brilliance.
                  In fact, silk inclusions can increase the value of a sapphire.
                  The heat treatments used to alter color and clarity in blue
                  sapphires break down rutile silk, so the presence of intact
                  silk indicates that a sapphire is unheated. Certain other
                  solid and liquid inclusions burst or deform under extreme heat
                  and are also useful indicators of heat treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Heat treatment and diffusion make attractive blue sapphires
                  out of common corundum that would have little or no value
                  without treatment. Heat treatment is widely used in the
                  international sapphire market, and it is estimated that well
                  over 90 percent of all blue sapphire in the market today has
                  been subject to heat treatment. Diffusion treatment is far
                  more controversial, and diffusion-treated blue sapphires sell
                  for much less than those which have only been heat-treated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Blue sapphires are found in a number of locations around the
                  world including Kashmir, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Madagascar,
                  Thailand, Australia, Tanzania, and the state of Montana in the
                  United States.

                <h4 className="text_primary">Yellow Sapphires</h4>
                <p>
                  After blue sapphires, yellow sapphires are the most sought
                  after color in today’s jewelry industry. Many yellow sapphires
                  are thought to closely resemble yellow diamonds. They can
                  range in color from bright canary yellow to greenish yellow,
                  to everything in between. While customers tend to prefer a
                  yellow sapphire color that is a medium, vibrant canary yellow,
                  a deep, orangish yellow (whisky color), is highly valued in
                  some Asian markets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most common cause of the yellow coloration in a sapphire
                  is the trace element iron. Typically speaking, increased iron
                  concentrations will also increase color saturation. Yellow
                  sapphires can also be colored naturally by low-level radiation
                  within the earth or by lab-induced irradiation. Gemstones that
                  obtain their color through irradiation have been known to fade
                  with exposure to heat and light. Heat treatments have vastly
                  increased the supply of yellow sapphires on the market today.
                  Unheated yellow sapphires with strong saturation remain quite
                  rare.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yellow sapphires frequently have fewer inclusions than other
                  sapphire colors, and are held to higher clarity’s than other
                  sapphire colors. The trace element titanium may cause an
                  undesirable green cast in yellow sapphires, which makes the
                  most valuable gemstone those that are relatively
                  titanium-free. (The titanium-bearing rutile silk is less
                  common in fine yellow sapphires than sapphires of other
                  colors.) Yellow sapphire’s transparency and clarity is
                  paramount to the value of the sapphire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yellow sapphire rough has traditionally been less costly than
                  blue, pink, or Padparadscha (a mixture of pink and orange), so
                  cutters are more reluctant to compromise brilliance in favor
                  of weight retention. As a result, well-cut yellow sapphires
                  are easier to find than other sapphire colors. (Yellow
                  sapphires are also more likely to be available in specialty
                  cuts such as radiant cuts which enhance the color of the
                  gemstone.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yellow sapphires are found in Tanzania, Madagascar, Thailand
                  and Australia, although Sri Lanka is the primary source.

                <h4 className="text_primary">Pink Sapphires</h4>
                <p>
                  Pink sapphires come in very pale pastel pinks to vibrant and
                  intense hot pinks. Pink sapphires are colored by traces of
                  chromium. Lower concentrations of chromium create pink
                  sapphires while very high chromium concentrations will create
                  a ruby. If the trace element titanium is included in the
                  crystal structure, the sapphire will have a more purplish pink
                  hue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because pink sapphires are rare, gemstones half a carat or
                  more are not cut into calibrated sizes. Instead, each gemstone
                  will be cut to retain as much of the gemstone as possible. A
                  mixed cut will enhance the beauty of the color and retain the
                  weight of the gemstone. Customers will find that the most
                  common shapes are cushions or ovals. Eye-clean, untreated
                  gemstones are available on the market, but the majority of
                  pink sapphires have had their clarity enhanced by heat
                  treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many of the sapphires from Madagascar are subjected to
                  moderate heat treatments to reduce their purplish secondary
                  colors. Moderate heat treatments are very different from the
                  traditional long duration, high temperature heating of blue
                  and yellow sapphires. Madagascar pink sapphires, on the other
                  hand, are heated at temperatures far lower and are considered
                  more gentle (about 400º C) for only a few hours. This process
                  does not alter the internal characteristics of the gemstone
                  while high heat temperatures will affect the inclusions
                  drastically.
